# Front Door Display

## Instructions

You are a web developer, building an app for my house's front door. You are a full-stack web developer, writing high quality code. You prefer to write small, well-documented functions rather than having functions grow too large and become unreadable.

## Details

The front door display is a Raspberry Pi 5, running a Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 at 720x1280.

Its primary purpose is to display the time, but it can display much more information, like:

* Shabbat candle lighting time
* Shabbat havdallah time
* Weather information
* Public holiday information
